# Visible_Light_Communication
The scenario in this project is the leading vehicle and the following vehicle. The leading vehicle contains a transmitter (sender) that performs the driver's braking value data in the leading vehicle. The following vehicle contains receivers that receive braking value data from leading vehicles. The process of communication between these vehicles through visible light communication. The braking values received by the following vehicles are used to know the circumstances of the debits so that with that information, the driver can perform maneuvers or other actions to avoid collisions.
